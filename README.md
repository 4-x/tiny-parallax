## How to use it
Include `tiny-parallax.css` and `tiny-parallax.js` in your page.

Add classes to elements in the following format `par-<direction>-<speed>`. Where direction is the direction that the element should move when you scroll and speed is an integer between 0 and 20. So the class name should look something like this `par-up-02`.
